# Dart Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment

This repository contains a Dart program that demonstrates various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart, including classes, inheritance, interfaces, file handling, and method usage. The program is designed to fulfill the requirements of a technical assignment challenge aimed at assessing the understanding of OOP principles in Dart.

## Features

The Dart program in this repository includes the following features:

1. **Object-Oriented Model with Classes and Inheritance**: Defines a base class `Animal` and a derived class `Dog` that demonstrates inheritance.

2. **Interface Implementation**: Defines an interface `Vehicle` and a class `Car` that implements this interface.

3. **Method Overriding**: Demonstrates method overriding by providing a specialized implementation of the `makeSound()` method in the `Dog` class.

4. **File Initialization**: Initializes an instance of the `Person` class with data read from a file named `person.txt`.

5. **Loop Method**: Includes a method `printNumbers()` that demonstrates the usage of a loop.

## Getting Started

To run the Dart program locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Dart SDK installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/dart-oop-assignment.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd dart-program
   ```

4. Run the Dart program using the Dart VM:

   ```bash
   dart main.dart
   ```

   This will execute the program and display the output in the console.

## File Structure

The repository has the following structure:

```
dart-oop-assignment/
│
├── main.dart        # Main Dart program file
├── person.txt       # Sample data file for initializing Person instance
└── README.md        # Detailed documentation about the repository
```

## Usage

Feel free to explore the Dart program and modify it as needed for your own learning purposes or for use in other projects. You can customize the classes, methods, and data according to your requirements.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the code or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. Contributions from the community are highly appreciated!
